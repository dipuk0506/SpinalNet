This folder contains four scripts, training different NNs on different MNIST datasets.
As it is training from the scratch, accuracies are not that high.
There is a demonstration of receiving high accuracy through transfer learning at the Jupyter Notebooks folder. 

https://github.com/dipuk0506/SpinalNet/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/transfer-learning-on-mnist-with-vgg.ipynb

In that notebook, test Accuracy, corresponding to the best validation accuracy = 99.75%.
